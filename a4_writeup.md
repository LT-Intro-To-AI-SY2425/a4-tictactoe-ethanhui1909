# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
    The most difficult part to tic-tac-toe was finding an efficent way to validate all the win-cases for a single player. This required me to create every win case possible, which took an incredible amount of effort, or create a loop for every win-case that created a trend, which also was difficult in its own way. 

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
    I could add a computer player to this game by adding a function into the TTTBoard class that inserted moves onto the board without the use of an input. 

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
    I could get the computer player to make the best move possible by conducting a survey of the board through a for loop, and then I could use that dataset to determine which move the computer makes would be the most optimal in that present situation.
